# Welcome to the sventon project! #

__Please note that the sventon project is no longer maintained. Current code and documentation is kept here at GitHub for reference. Thanks for using sventon.__

sventon is a free, open source, web client for browsing [Subversion](http://subversion.apache.org/) repositories. It is powerful, straightforward to use, and super easy to install.

sventon is a pure Java application, all you need to run it is a [Java SE 6 runtime](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/) and a Servlet 2.4/JSP 2.0 compliant webserver, such as [Tomcat 6.0](http://tomcat.apache.org/). Installation is truly simple, we will have you up and running in no-time!

Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/sventonsvn/sventon/wiki) for further details.

The sventon dev blog went to sleep [here](http://sventonblog.blogspot.se/).
